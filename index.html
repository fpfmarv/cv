      <h2>Nice to meet you!</h2>
      <p>My name is Marvin, but most people call me Marv. I live in San Diego where I was born and raised, but I have also lived in Las Vegas and Atlanta. I have a dog named Deku, he's a good dog. I'm a trained chef and have worked in
        professional kitchens for the last 20 years, but I'm trying to learn the skills to start a new career in Web Development.</p>
      <p>This is a sample web site that I'm making to teach myself the basics of web coding and development. Hopefully by the time this excersice is done I'll have a fully functioning navigable website. This is my first foray into the world of site
        building, so please forgive me if this page looks kind of rough.</p>

      <p> For now, just feel free to look around or come back later after I've learned how to do more. Let's go!</p>

        <h3>Cooking & Baking</h3>
        <p>Before I ventured into the world of web development I was a trained chef with 20 years of experience working in pro kitchens all over the United States. I made the decision to move on from that career path but I still love to cook!</p>
